description: "Webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when video renders are completed or failed. Instead of polling our API, webhooks will send HTTP requests to your server when these events occur.."
---

## Events

The following webhook events are available:

- `render.completed`: Triggered when a video render completes successfully
- `render.failed`: Triggered when a video render fails

## Setting up Webhooks

### 1. Create a Webhook Endpoint

First, create an endpoint on your server to receive webhook events. The endpoint should be publicly accessible.

### 2. Register the Webhook

Register the webhook using the dashboard. Go to dashboard in the webhook panel and add your webhook endpoint.

## Webhook Payload

When an event occurs, you'll receive a POST request with the following payload structure:

```json
{
  "event": "render.completed",
  "data": {
    "_id": "render-id",
    "status": "completed",
    "outputUrl": "https://cdn.example.com/video.mp4",
    "error": "",
    "videoId": "video-id",
    "videoVersion": 1
    "videoData": {
      // ... complete video data
    },
    "createdAt": "2024-03-20T10:30:00Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-03-20T10:31:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Security

### Verifying Webhook Signatures

To ensure the webhook request came from us, we include a signature in the `X-Signature` header. Here's how to verify it:

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, secret) {
  const expectedSignature = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(JSON.stringify(payload))
    .digest("hex");

  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(signature),
    Buffer.from(expectedSignature)
  );
}

// In your webhook handler:
app.post("/webhook", (req, res) => {
  const signature = req.headers["X-Signature"];
  const payload = req.body;

  if (!verifyWebhookSignature(payload, signature, "your-webhook-secret")) {
    return res.status(401).send("Invalid signature");
  }

  // Process the webhook
  console.log("Received valid webhook:", payload.event);
  res.status(200).send("OK");
});
```

### Best Practices

1. Always verify the webhook signature
2. Handle duplicate events (use the render ID as an idempotency key)
3. Store your webhook secret securely
